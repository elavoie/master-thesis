\emph{``We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97\% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3\%. A good programmer will not be lulled into complacency by such reasoning, he will be wise to look carefully at the critical code; but only after that code has been identified''}

\section{Inline primitive operations}

\section{Inline caching of message sends}

Invariants: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parent objects never share a map (a map change happens when a child is created)
    \item values are only cached when found on a parent object
    \item value caches are only present on parent objects
\end{itemize}

Problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Caching a "call" message
\end{itemize}
